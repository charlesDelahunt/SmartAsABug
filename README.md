Status: Code is now posted :-)

A full version of this code is now posted at github/charlesDelahunt/PuttingABugInML.
 
The version at PuttingABugInML simulates a moth olfactory network as it learns to read MNIST digits. It generates a model of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory network, then runs a time-stepped evolution of SDEs to train the network to read downsampled MNIST digits.The mechanics of the moth architecture generation and the SDE evolution are largely the same as the variant of the codebase due to live here.

This repository will (eventually) contain code used in the paper "Biological Mechanisms for Learning: A Computational Model of Olfactory Learning in the Manduca sexta Moth, with Applications to Neural Nets", by CB Delahunt, JA Riffell, and JN Kutz, January 2018.


If you have questions or comments, please email Charles Delahunt at delahunt@uw.edu, or find us at ICLR 2018.

Thank you!
