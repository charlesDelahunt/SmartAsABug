This repository contains code used in the paper "Biological Mechanisms for Learning: A Computational Model of Olfactory Learning in the Manduca sexta Moth, with Applications to Neural Nets", by CB Delahunt, JA Riffell, and JN Kutz, January 2018.

Status: We're refactoring the Matlab code base for easier use. We expect to upload clean code before 30 April 2018. 

If you have questions or comments, or wish to access material not yet posted, please email Charles Delahunt at delahunt@uw.edu, or find us at ICLR.

Thank you!
